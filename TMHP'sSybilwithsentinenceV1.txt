### Step 1: Set Up the Rust Backend

1. **Create a new Rust project:**
    ```bash
    cargo new quantum_reinforcement
    cd quantum_reinforcement
    ```

2. **Update `Cargo.toml` to include dependencies:**
    Add the following dependencies:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    rocket = "0.5.0-rc.1"
    serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
    serde_json = "1.0"
    qrand = "0.2"
    rand = "0.8"
    ```

3. **Implement the backend logic in `src/main.rs`:**
    Implement the necessary Rust code that defines the server and the endpoints for handling the quantum reinforcement learning.

### Step 2: Set Up the Frontend

1. **Create a new directory for the frontend:**
    ```bash
    mkdir frontend
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Create `index.html`:**
    Create an HTML file that defines the form and JavaScript code to interact with the Rust backend.

### Step 3: Run the Backend Server

1. **Navigate to your Rust project directory and start the Rocket server:**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

### Step 4: Serve the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the `frontend` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Start a simple HTTP server to serve the `index.html` file:**
    You can use Python's built-in HTTP server for this purpose:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    ```

### Step 5: Access the Application

1. **Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the frontend.**
    - Fill in the input fields (number of qubits, iterations, and actions).
    - Click "Execute" to run the quantum reinforcement learning process.
    - The output will be displayed below the form.

### Summary

- **Backend:** Set up a Rocket-based Rust server to handle the quantum reinforcement learning logic.
- **Frontend:** Create a simple HTML page with a form to collect user inputs and JavaScript to send those inputs to the Rust server.
- **Interaction:** The frontend sends user inputs to the backend, which processes them and returns the results, displayed by the frontend.

This guide ensures you have an interactive full stack application without integrating the frontend directly into the backend. You can modify and expand the functionality as needed.
